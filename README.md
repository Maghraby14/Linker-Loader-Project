# Linker_Loader

This repository contains Python scripts for absolute and linking loaders. The loaders take a HTE (Header Text Entry) file as input and generate the output for the absolute loader and the linking loader.

## Files

### absolute.py

The `absolute.py` script implements an absolute loader. It takes a HTE file as input and produces the output of the absolute loader.

### linking.py

The `linking.py` script implements a linking loader. Similar to `absolute.py`, it takes a HTE file as input and generates the output of the linking loader.

## How to Use

1. Ensure you have Python installed on your system.

2. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/linker_loader.git
3. Navigate to the cloned directory:
    ```bash
  cd linker_loader
4. Place your HTE input file in the repository directory.
 ```bash
        python absolute.py input.txt
```
 ```bash
   python linking.py input.txt
```

5. Run the desired loader script with the input file:
6. The loader script will generate the output of the loader process.
